# Nicolas Barré

Computer engineer and computational physicist working at the intersection of inverse problems, optical design, and efficient numerical methods.

## Current Projects

**[FluxOptics.jl](https://github.com/anscoil/FluxOptics.jl)**, a Julia library for differentiable wave propagation and inverse optical design.

A Julia library unifying several years of work in computational optics, emphasizing composable architectures and efficient algorithms suitable for gradient-based optimization. Designed for practical inverse design and characterization of optical components.

## Collaboration

I'm interested in applying computational methods to challenging inverse problems, particularly in optics and physical simulation. Open to collaboration on projects involving differentiable programming, optimization, or physics-based modeling.

Available for consulting and short-term technical projects in computational physics and inverse design.
